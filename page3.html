            <p>Orange cats are known for having some pretty particular and charming personalities. Not every cat is an individual, but there are some common characteristics associated with these felines. These include the following.

                Social and affable: most of the orange cats are social and, in fact, enjoy being around humans. They tend to be very affectionate and like being with their owners.
                
                Playful and active: Although having the reputation of being laid-back, many orange cats are rather energetic and love games, as well as other physical activities.
                
                Confident and secure: They usually possess great self-assurance and a positive attitude toward life.
                
                Intelligent and curious: They are quite clever and attentive cats; hence, they are very enjoyable companions to be around and to play with.
                
                Independent: Though social, they also enjoy their private moments.</p>
